# NoteableIO
<div> 
NoteableIO is a note-taking web app primarily used with watching videos. Users are allowed to produce live stream videos while viewers take notes on the video. These notes can then be saved and passed around. This project was made during the hackathon, HackBCA 2014 and is built on Ruby on Rails. The team consisted of Erich Chu, Kevin Baichoo and Jake Christensen.
